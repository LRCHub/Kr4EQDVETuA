[00:29.35] She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
[00:33.29] I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
[00:38.55] Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
[00:43.50] She said I am the one
[00:46.90] Who will dance on the floor in the round
[00:53.87] She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
[00:57.93] Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
[01:03.39] Who will dance on the floor in the round
[01:23.39] 
[01:09.95] People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
[01:13.64] Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (hee-eeh)
[01:17.94] And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
[01:21.77] And be careful of what you do (oh, oh)
[01:23.78] 'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (oh, oh), eh-eh
[01:26.61] Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
[01:30.53] She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby)
[01:35.62] But the kid is not my son (ooh!), uh
[01:40.74] She says I am the one (oh, baby)
[01:43.89] But the kid is not my son
[01:47.17] (Hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee, ooh!) no, no
[01:50.93] For 40 days and for 40 nights, I was on her side
[01:55.05] But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
[02:00.48] 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (hee)
[02:05.19] So take my strong advice
[02:08.48] Just remember to always think twice
[02:12.66] (Don't think twice!) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo)
[02:15.50] She told my baby we'd danced 'til 3:00, then she looked at me
[02:19.91] Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
[02:24.77] 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
[02:29.49] (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
[02:31.65] People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
[02:35.26] And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (don't break no hearts)
[02:39.60] But she came and stood right by me
[02:41.67] Just the smell of sweet perfume
[02:43.84] This happened much too soon
[02:45.80] She called me to her room, hey
[02:48.54] Billie Jean is not my lover (hoo)
[02:52.51] She's just a girl who claims that I am the one, uh
[02:57.69] But the kid is not my son
[03:01.68] No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (hoo)
[03:05.19] Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
[03:08.85] She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby)
[03:13.98] But the kid is not my son (no, no)
[03:18.90] She says I am the one (oh, baby)
[03:22.05] But the kid is not my son
[03:26.71] (No, hee-hee)
[03:33.21] 
[03:30.74] Hee! Hoo!
[03:35.24] 
[03:43.63] She says I am the one, uh
[03:46.65] But the kid is not my son
[03:50.49] No-no-no, hoo (oh)
[03:54.17] Billie Jean is not my lover
[03:58.30] She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (you know what you did to me, baby)
[04:03.12] But the kid is not my son
[04:06.30] No-no-no, no-no-no-no
[04:08.20] She says I am the one (no)
[04:11.32] But the kid is not my son (no-no-no)
[04:16.46] She says I am the one (you know what you did)
[04:20.66] She says he is my son (breakin' my heart, babe)
[04:24.47] She says I am the one
[04:26.65] Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
[04:30.76] Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
[04:34.76] Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
[04:38.80] Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
[04:43.37] Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (she's not at the scene)
[04:47.00] Yeah, Billie Jean is not...
