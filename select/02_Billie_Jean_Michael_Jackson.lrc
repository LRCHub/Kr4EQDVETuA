[00:29.18] She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
[00:32.74] I said "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one"
[00:38.36] Who will dance on the floor in the round?
[00:43.37] She said I am the one
[00:46.01] Who will dance on the floor in the round?
[01:06.51] 
[00:52.90] She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
[00:57.43] Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
[01:02.83] Who will dance on the floor in the round?
[01:23.33] 
[01:09.58] People always told me "be careful of what you do
[01:13.62] And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
[01:16.63] (Hee-hee)
[01:17.64] And mother always told me "be careful of who you love
[01:21.54] And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth"
[01:53.04] 
[01:25.89] Billie Jean is not my lover
[01:30.09] She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[01:35.29] But the kid is not my son
[01:41.16] She says I am the one
[01:43.97] But the kid is not my son
[01:56.47] 
[01:50.93] For forty days and forty nights
[01:53.74] The law was on her side
[01:55.15] But who can stand when she's in demand her schemes and plans
[02:00.12] 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
[02:04.47] So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
[02:10.49] (Do think twice, do think twice)
[02:26.49] 
[02:13.10] She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
[02:17.24] Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
[02:22.40] 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
[02:46.40] 
[02:29.18] People always told me
[02:30.56] "Be careful of what you do
[02:32.67] And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
[02:36.17] She came and stood right by me
[02:38.84] Just the smell of sweet perfume
[02:40.90] This happened much too soon
[02:42.94] She called me to her room
[02:55.44]
